# Water Fountain with Lights and Music Show

This repository contains Python scripts for creating a mesmerizing water fountain show with synchronized lights and music. The system is based on an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) which allows for efficient real-time processing and control of the water pumps and LED strips. The scripts in this repository are responsible for extracting music features and mapping them to the water pumps and LED stripes, enabling a dynamic and captivating show.

There are two scripts present in this repository. One is the main.py script, which is still a work in progress and is supposed to be a simulation of the FPGA's behaviour. On the other hand there is the simplified version, which returns hardcoded values from extracted song features for both the pump and the LED strip that you can plug into your FPGA project.
